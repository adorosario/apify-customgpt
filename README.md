## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An Apify account with API access
- A CustomGPT account with API access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/adorosario/apify-customgpt.git
   cd apify-customgpt
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_apify_api_token
   CUSTOMGPT_API_KEY=your_customgpt_api_key
   ```

2. Run the script with the required arguments:
   ```
   python main.py --starting-url <URL> --prompt <prompt>
   ```
   Replace `<URL>` with the website you want to scrape and `<prompt>` with the initial question for your AI agent.

3. Monitor the console output for progress updates and the final AI agent response.

## Configuration

### Apify Setup

1. Sign up for an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/).
2. Navigate to your account settings.
