## How To Use It?
We provide an easy to use [no-code hosted Streamlit app](https://apify-to-customgpt.streamlit.app/). You can also self-host the Streamlit app if you'd like.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An Apify account with API access
- A CustomGPT account with API access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/adorosario/apify-customgpt.git
   cd apify-customgpt
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Streamlit App

1. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_apify_api_token
   CUSTOMGPT_API_KEY=your_customgpt_api_key
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

4. Use the web interface to enter the starting URL, and follow the on-screen instructions to scrape and transfer data.

### Command Line Interface

1. Set up your environment variables as described above.

2. Run the script with the required arguments:
   ```
   python main.py --starting-url <URL> --prompt <prompt>
   ```
   Replace `<URL>` with the website you want to scrape and `<prompt>` with the initial question for your AI agent.

3. Monitor the console output for progress updates and the final AI agent response.

## Configuration

### Apify Setup

1. Sign up for an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/).
2. Navigate to your account settings.
3. Find your API token in the Integrations section.

2. Navigate to your profile settings.
3. Find your API key in the API section.
4. Use this API key in your `.env` file.
